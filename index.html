## Overview

The "Programming with Big Data in [R](http://www.r-project.org/)"
project (pbdR) enables high-level distributed data parallelism in R, so
that it can easily utilize large HPC platforms with thousands of cores,
making the R language scale to unparalleled heights. We interpret big
data quite literally to mean that its size requires parallel processing
either because it does not fit in the memory of a single multicore
machine or because we need to make its processing time tolerable.

We achieve this, in part, by providing a simple interface to scalable,
high performance libraries, such as
[MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface),
[ScaLAPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScaLAPACK), and
[NetCDF4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF). The routines in these
libraries are engaged through R's classes and methods, so that the R
language syntax is largely preserved, but with new, scalable, compiled
code underneath. Most of the cumbersome distributed details are
abstracted away for the user, although they are readily accessible
should the user desire them. While these libraries shine brightest on
large distributed platforms, they also work rather well on small
clusters and often, surprisingly, even on a laptop with only two cores.

We provide [several R packages](packages.html) which focus on analyzing
big data, especially on large distributed machines. The packages are
meant to be used in the [Single Program/Multiple Data
(SPMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPMD) programming model ([see
also](http://thirteen-01.stat.iastate.edu/snoweye/hpsc/?item=spmd)),
with special focus on large scale computing clusters. Packages and
instructions for installation are available on the [downloads
page](download.html).



## Bugs/Suggestions/Questions/Comments

In order to provide the best possible set of packages, we need user
input. For suggestions, questions, comments, bug reports, or anything
else relevant that you wish to communicate, please do not hesitate to
contact us.

We maintain a google group,
[RBigDataProgramming](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rbigdataprogramming),
where you are encouraged to post discussions about the project,
including any issues you may be experiencing. The developers monitor the
group email. You can also email the respective package's maintainer.
