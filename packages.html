## Packages

If you have no idea where to begin and/or have limited experience with
MPI programming, start by checking out the [pbdDEMO package](#demo),
especially the [pbdDEMO
vignette](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbdDEMO/vignettes/pbdDEMO-guide.pdf).

|General            | I/O                |  Computation       |   Application
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------
|[pbdDEMO](#demo)   | [pbdNCDF4](#ncdf4) |  [pbdDMAT](#dmat)  |  [pmclust](#pmclust)
| [pbdMPI](#mpi)    |                    |  [pbdBASE](#dmat)  | 
| [pbdPROF](#prof)  |                    |   [pbdSLAP](#dmat) |

### General

###### pbdDEMO <a name="#demo"></a>

This package offers a comprehensive set of over 20 pbdR package demos,
and a textbook-style vignette that can quickly help you take your
programming from 1 to 10,000+ cores.

This package offers:

-   A gentle introduction to high performance computing with R using the
    pbdR tools.
-   An impressive set of non-trivial examples and companion text,
    specifically written with data scientists in mind.

###### pbdMPI <a name="#mpi"></a>

This package provides an efficient interface to MPI by utilizing R's S4
classes and methods with a focus on Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD)
parallel programming style, which is intended for batch parallel
execution. pbdMPI functions are SPMD extensions of MPI functions,
rewritten from
[Rmpi](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpi/index.html) with many
performance improvements, as well as a simplified interface.

This package offers:

-   High-level, abstract interface to low-level, fast MPI code.
-   Performance gains from directly calling MPI functions.
-   Reductions in cost of compression in communication.
-   Easy programming and debugging efforts.

###### <a name="#prof"></a> pbdPROF 

This package provides access to MPI profiling by way of managing the
complicated compiling and linking issues. In this way, a user need only
install pbdPROF and then pass an install flag for an MPI-using R package
(which has been set up for compatibility with pbdPROF). Additionally,
the package offers parsing and plotting utilities for profiler outputs.

Like all of our packages, pbdPROF has a very useful vignette, especially
for package developers who are directly interfacing to MPI with compiled
code (C or Fortran). Currently, only the profiler
[fpmpi](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/fpmpi/WWW/features.html)
is supported, although we plan to soon support
[mpiP](http://mpip.sourceforge.net/) and
[TAU](http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/paracomp/tau/tauprofile/images/openmpi/)

This package offers:

-   Easy installation.
-   The ability to profile MPI-using R code.
-   Parsing and plotting utilities for understanding profiler output.

\
### I/O

###### pbdNCDF4 {#ncdf4}

This package offers a friendly syntax to enable the management of
[NetCDF4](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) data in parallel
for R users. To get the most out of this package, you need to have a
parallel file system available.

This package offers:

-   Fast, efficient wrappers for reading and writing NetCDF4 data in
    parallel.
-   An extension of the
    [ncdf4](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ncdf4/index.html)
    package.

\
### Computation

###### pbdDMAT, pbdBASE, and pbdSLAP {#dmat}

These packages offer high-level syntax for large scale, distributed
matrix algebra and statistics operations. Users need only worry about
installing all three and learning pbdDMAT. However, developers and
anyone with access to commercial matrix algebra libraries
([MKL](http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl),
[LibSci](http://www.nersc.gov/users/software/programming-libraries/math-libraries/libsci/),
...) should, at the least, see the pbdBASE and pbdSLAP vignettes,
respectively.

These packages provide:

-   Nearly-native R syntax, but with massive scalability.
-   A host of matrix and statistics operations, everything from
    `` `[` `` to `lm.fit()`.
-   Simple installation of high performance libraries.

\
### Application

###### pmclust

This package implements parallel model-based clustering, an unsupervised
learning technique, for high dimensional and ultra large distributed
data. The package employs pbdMPI to perform an
expectation-gathering-maximization (EGM) algorithm for finite mixture
Gaussian models.

This package offers:

-   Fast, high-level model-based clustering for .
-   An implementation of k-means clustering using the distributed matrix
    methods of pbdDMAT.
